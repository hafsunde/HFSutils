\title{Add noise to achieve unit variance}
\usage{
noise_filler(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with variance approximately equal to 1.
}
\description{
Adds Gaussian noise to a numeric vector so that the resulting
sample variance equals 1, if the original variance is below 1.
}
\details{
If the sample variance of \code{x} is greater than or equal to 1,
the input is returned unchanged and a warning is issued.

Random noise is drawn from a normal distribution. Results are
stochastic unless a random seed is set externally.
